That's right, we need your help! So check out our friends at ElectronicsMod,
seriously they have the love ;) By ordering with them not only do you get
quality products, but you also help XeLove reach it's goal of being able to
purchase a Dev 360.

Thanks for the supports guys.

Note on Jazz Jackrabbit. The two bugs I was talking about yesterday seem to be a
bigger problem than I originally thought. Luckly they are the same fault, but
it's being a bitch to debug. A dev 360 would help me resolve this bug in a
matter of minutes. I'm currently a few hours into debugging... Well that seems
like enough for today :P
