**Team XeLove Presents**
XeBoyAdvance - VBA based GBA Emulator for the Xbox 360.
Website: http://lovemhz.com
IRC: #XeLove, EFNet

**Information**
Hey, it's LoveMHz here again from Team XeLove to present are fantastic emulator
XeBoyAdvance. A lot of work has went into this port. The 360 is a wonderful
platform, sometimes it's a pain, but none the less, we have achieved high goals
for GBA emulation on it. So far we've spent about 2 months on this port. Work so
far has been done on a retail console, therefore it has really slowed down the
process. Soon we will release the payment details for people that want to
donate. So if you enjoy GBA, or simple want to see more ports (NES, N64, and PSX
to just name a few) then please donate. And of course none of this would
possible without the support of all of you.

**About VirtualBoyAdvance**
It's been a real pleasure to have worked with such a great code base and the
people whom are still active within the group. Without them none of this would
be possible. *Even if they do like to stab me in IRC*

> The VisualBoyAdvance project was started by Forgotten.[6] When this person
left the development of the emulator, the project was handed over to a team
named VBA Team, led by hacker kxu. Development on the original VisualBoyAdvance
stopped in 2004 with versions 1.7.2 and 1.8.0 beta 3, and a number of forked
versions were made by various developers in the years since then.
