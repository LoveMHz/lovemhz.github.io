It's been somewhat of a delay, but XeDOSBox's Google Project page has been
updated.. Also included are Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008 project
files. So check it out, start filling out bug reports, and let's make this one
Xbox360 port to remember.

Nothing much to say yet expect for that the first N64 emulator for the Xbox360
is in the works. Work has been progressing along smoothly for the last month now
and things are starting to shape up. No screenshots yet, but I'll keep my blog
updated as things come along.

Donation button is now fixed. Sorry to the people that wanted to donate and
couldn't.. We had an issue with the PayPal account that we was using. All of
that's sorted out now. Donations are need as progress for new and exciting
things to happen. Currently I have a few secret projects that I'm working on and
of course some of it will take longer to make without your help. If you would
like more details about what's needed and would like to help then please contact
me.
