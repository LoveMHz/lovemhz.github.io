## Apologies
It’s not easy to admit when you’re wrong, but I want to start there.

My frustration comes from the people who are actively stealing and cloning our hardware and software, and from those
spreading misinformation to protect or promote that theft. It's the groups that hide behind anonymity to mask their acts
while at the same time constantly shouting, "it wasn't me."

That said, the best apologies are short and sincere. While we may still disagree on some things, I want to apologize to
Harcroft, Skye, and Eaton for involving you in this situation. My issues are not with you or your projects. I had
incorrectly associated you with efforts I do have a problem with, based on the information I had at the time. Since then,
I’ve received clarification and want to set the record straight.

It was unprofessional, and I will do better moving forward. I have updated the original blog post.
