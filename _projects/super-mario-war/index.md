**Description**
Super Mario War is an old favorite of mine in terms of free and open source
games. Back in 2010 I initially became involved in porting Super Mario War to
the Microsoft Xbox 360 system via a custom DirectX 9 based SDL library. In late
2015 work began on porting the game to the Nintendo 3DS.

It’s been a real pleasure to have worked with such a great code base and the
people whom are still active within the group. Without them none of this would
be possible.

**About Super Mario War**

> Super Mario War is a game for up to four players with many different modes of
play. The basic goal of the game is to be the last player standing, and to
accomplish this goal you must jump on your opponents heads to kill them. There
are many Mario-themed items you can use to help you kill your opponents, as
well. In addition, there are several variation on this basic gameplay mechanic
which you can try, such as Chicken, Capture The Flag, and so on. Plus, for those
who enjoy customization, there are several aspects of the game which you can
tweak to your liking through the Options menus, and if you like, you can make
your own maps, skins, and other custom content to use (or download others’ to
use), too!
