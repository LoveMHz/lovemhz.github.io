**About VirtualBoyAdvance**  
It's been a real pleasure to have worked with such a great code base and the
people whom are still active within the group. Without them none of this would
be possible.

> The VisualBoyAdvance project was started by Forgotten.[6] When this person
left the development of the emulator, the project was handed over to a team
named VBA Team, led by hacker kxu. Development on the original VisualBoyAdvance
stopped in 2004 with versions 1.7.2 and 1.8.0 beta 3, and a number of forked
versions were made by various developers in the years since then.
