I've finally got my Developer's Kit =D I want to give a huge a thanks to
NoRemorse, el_aprend, SonicISO, Team XeDev, and everyone that's donated to the
team =) Just from using it for a few hours I can already say that this is going
to speed up development HUGELY. I probably would still be sorting out the bug in
the DOSBox port. So thanks again everyone =D

Provided above areÂ a few screenshots of Windows 3.1 installing on my developer's
kit.
