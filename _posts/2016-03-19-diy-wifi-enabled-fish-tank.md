I recently purchased a
[Aquarius AQ11204 BettaView Brite Corner Tank](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B4IKXS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001B4IKXS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lo0e1-20&amp;linkId=JJZXX7ZZAQ2P7VXI)
and a cheerfully blue betta fish. The tank is a simple corner shaped tank that
fits perfectly on my desk and adds a bit of life to the mountain of technology
that every other inch of my office occupies. This particular tank also
incorporates a multi-mode RGB LED that can cycle through different modes by
pressing the button at the top. Overall, even without modifications, it's a
great tank!

But.. the lighting is a bit lacking. The light can only be toggled to stay on
for a few hours after a complicated sequence of long and short button presses.
The lighting modes are quite boring with only a few solid colors and an awkward
attempt at PWM control of the LEDs for the fading. Now this got me thinking how
I could improve this. I've had a bag full of ESP8266 boards for a while now,
almost 6 months, that I haven't done anything with.

For those who do not know anything about the ESP8266; it's specs are as follows:

* Cost is less than $2 shipped!
* Wi-Fi chip with full TCP/IP stack
* 80 MHz Microcontroller
* 64 KiB of instruction RAM
* 96 KiB RAM
* External 512 KiB flash.

In short, a powerful enough WiFi enabled microcontroller to control both the IO
devices and host a basic HTTP server on the cheap!

So let's get started! The goal for this project were as followed.

* Weekend project. Shouldn't take more than two days from start to finish.
* Monitor and record water temperature every 30 seconds.
* Text message alert if the water temperature reaches a concerning level.
* Mobile friendly web interface for changing the color and effect mode.
(Constant color, fading, etc)

Parts List
==========

The links provided below are through the Amazon Affiliate program. If you want
to do this project, and don't mind waiting for the parts, then I highly recommend
buying most of them off of eBay. Buying from eBay should lower the project cost
(minus the tank) to around $12 bucks!

Brief Overview
==============
![Brief Overview](/assets/img/blog/diy-wifi-enabled-fish-tank/brief_overview_header.jpg)
On top of the tank is a removable, oblong puck shaped module that encloses the
RGB LEDs, the big blue button for controlling the LEDs, a 5V power barrel input
port and a battery slot for 3 AAA batteries.

![LED Module](/assets/img/blog/diy-wifi-enabled-fish-tank/led_module.png)

LED Module
----------

Inside of the LED Module, for the lack of a better name, consists of a few bare
components. From left to right we find the PCB, battery contacts and the 5v
power connector at the rear.

![LED PCB](/assets/img/blog/diy-wifi-enabled-fish-tank/led_pcb.png)

LED PCB
----------
The LED PCB pictured above is a simple layout consisting of MCU (removed in the
picture), an NPN transistor array with pull down resistors for each channel of
the RGB LEDs, self-power off logic(transistor + capacitor) and power button. The
MCU was not investigated due to it being unmarked and most likely being a masked
ROM. In the picture I've highlighted the pinout from the MCU footprint for each
of the RGB LED transistor leds and the button.

![Deconstruction](/assets/img/blog/diy-wifi-enabled-fish-tank/deconstruction.png)

Deconstruction
----------
Deconstruction was quite easy. Started by removing all of the components and
breaking the plastic pieces of the battery separator. In the future, I hope to
find the right Dremel bit for cleaning up such tasks. Not a lot of time was spent
freeing up space as there's plenty on the inside for what I wanted to do.

Schematic
=========
[![Schematic](/assets/img/blog/diy-wifi-enabled-fish-tank/schematic.png)](https://github.com/LoveMHz/WifiFishTank/blob/master/schematic/WifiFish.pdf)

The schematic for this project is actually quite simple and is built of a couple
sections. Were saving a lot time by directly controlling the transistors on the
LED PCB. The LEDs, wired in parallel, would normally pull too much current for
the ESP pins to handle, but in this case we should be fine since we're only
controlling the transistors directly.

**Power Input** -
The power input is the barrel jack located on the device and provides 5v to the
LED PCB and to the LD1117V33 voltage regulator.

**Power Input -&gt; 3.3v** - This is the 5v to 3.3v regulator along with the
associated stability capacitors.
[Datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LD1117V33.pdf)

**RGB PCB IC** - 
This section represents 4 of the MCU/IC pins found on the PCB as described
previously in the PCB LED section.

**ESP8266** - 
In this project I'm using the ESP8266 ESP-03. *CH_PD* must be tied high, 3.3v,
for the ESP8266 to turn on and *GPIO15* must be tied to ground. (More
information about the different board variations of the ESP8266 can be found
[here](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php?id=esp8266-module-family).) *GPIO0*,
also know as *PROG*, must be tied to ground on power to enter programming mode.

An optional decoupling cap of 0.1uf on the *VCC*/*GND* pins may be added,
but was omitted.

**ESP8266 - Debug Header** -
In this project I used a simple 1x4 pin header to breakout a connection for the
*TxD*, *RxD*, *5v*, and *GND*. This allowed me to program and debug with a 3.3v
USB serial cable that also provided 5v for the LED PCB.

**ESP8266 - Temp Probe** -
The temperature probe is a DS18B20 and was chosen as it comes in a waterproof
enclosure. The DS18B20 communicates over 1-Wire and a 4.7k pull down resistor is
used on the *VDD/DQ* pins.

Hardware
========
![Schematic](/assets/img/blog/diy-wifi-enabled-fish-tank/hardware.png)

The hardware is pretty straight forward. Following the schematic along with a
bit of hot glue. The connections were made on top of a piece of prototyping
board. As this is a one off prototype and won't be moving around I was not
worried about using hot glue or the appearance of the internal circuitry.
*Yummm hot glue.*

Software
========
![Schematic](/assets/img/blog/diy-wifi-enabled-fish-tank/software_screenshot.png)

The software is easily the most interesting part of this project for myself. The
project as a whole really demonstrates that the industry for IoT devices is
currently possible with the low cost of the hardware required. However, in a lot
of ways we lack the software needed to connect everything together. For this
project, the web interface is made of simple HTML, CSS and Javascript. For a
quick UI I went with  Bootstrap. This provides a clean and responsive interface
both for desktop and mobile.

Initially, I wanted to code this simple project using Angular or React, but was
worried about packing everything up on the ESP8266's somewhat limited 512 KiB of
storage. So in the end, I went with a more traditional solution of using jQuery
for the basic UI switching and GET based communication.

The C/C++ side of things was pretty straight forward as it's using the ESP8266
library for hosting and routing the HTTP server. The build process consists of
using the PlatformIO platform along with a Python script to build and compress
the HTML resources into C headers. The LED functions were initially coded by
myself, but later I came across "Arduino-RGBEffects", which I found to be better
structured and already had a clean cube/fade effect implemented.

Another great feature of ubidots is the event system. This allows me to set up
events for any condition based on the sensor I have installed which, in this
case, was the water temperature sensor. Currently, I have a text message alert
setup for, if the water temperature reaches an unsafe level of less than 65 °F
or greater than 80 °F, I will be alerted via text message.

The World of IoT
================
![Ubidots Dashboard](/assets/img/blog/diy-wifi-enabled-fish-tank/ubidots_dashboard.png)

While there's an increasingly large number of IoT implementation and tracking
services being released everyday, I chose to go with the ubidots due to it's
easy to use REST API and free tier of 0.5 million sensor updates (dots) per
month, with 1 month of historical storage. This allows me to track the water
temperature at a conservative rate of every 30 seconds and view the resulting
data for the month online from anywhere in the world.

Using this service solved one of my original concerns for this project on how to
implement tracking, both efficiently and quickly. Luckily, by using ubidots, I
went from a working prototype to having it fully implemented within an hour.

Conclusion
==========

Now that I'm the NSA of fish metadata tracking, I can sit back and think over
the project. This was a really fun project and I'm happy to say that I was able
to accomplish the original goals I had set out to complete.

The ESP8266 has been a wonderful chip to work with and the community support,
taking full advantage of it, has made it a breeze to use. This will most
definitely not be the last project I take on using the ESP8266.

In the future, I hope to more closely evaluate using Node JS instead of C/C++
for the main code. Alongside implementing a proper REST API, I hope to also
incorporate the MQTT protocol for a more complete IoT device.
