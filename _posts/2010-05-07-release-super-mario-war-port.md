> Super Mario War is a game for up to four players with many different modes of
play. The basic goal of the game is to be the last player standing, and to
accomplish this goal you must jump on your opponents' heads to kill them. There
are many Mario-themed items you can use to help you kill your opponents, as well.

This is the first release of my port of Super Mario War for the Xbox360.
Currently there seems to only be a few audio issues, but that should be taken
care of soon.
