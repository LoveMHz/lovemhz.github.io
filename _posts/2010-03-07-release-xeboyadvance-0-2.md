### Team XeLove Presents

**XeBoyAdvance - VBA based GBA Emulator for the Xbox 360.**
**Website** http://lovemhz.blogspot.com
**IRC** #XeLove, EFNet

### Information

Hey, it's LoveMHz here again from Team XeLove to present are fantastic emulator
XeBoyAdvance. A lot of work has went into this port. The 360 is a wonderful
platform, sometimes it's a pain, but none the less, we have achieved high goals
for GBA emulation on it. So far we've spent about 2 months on this port. Work so
far has been done on a retail console, therefore it has really slowed down the
process. Soon we will release the payment details for people that want to
donate. So if you enjoy GBA, or simple want to see more ports (NES, N64, and PSX
to just name a few) then please donate. And of course none of this would
possible without the support of all of you.

Thanks and feel free to join us on IRC, #XeLove on EFNet.

### About VirtualBoyAdvance

It's been a real pleasure to have worked with such a great code base and the
people whom are still active within the group. Without them none of this would
be possible.

> The VisualBoyAdvance project was started by Forgotten.[6] When this person left
the development of the emulator, the project was handed over to a team named VBA
Team, led by hacker kxu. Development on the original VisualBoyAdvance stopped in
2004 with versions 1.7.2 and 1.8.0 beta 3, and a number of forked versions were
made by various developers in the years since then.
