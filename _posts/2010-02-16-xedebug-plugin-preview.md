First off I want to give huge props to sascoo for his work on porting XeDebug to
C# and doing a amazing job of cleaning the code up (Both on the server and client
side).

Now about XeDebug.. I personally haven't had much time to work on XeDebug lately,
despite wanting to finish it up and add more features. But it seems like I don't
have much of an option seeing as Jazz Jackrabbit is simply being a pain in the
ass to debug..

Well today I have successfully got the XeDebug plugin for Visual Studios
finished. Now off to add variable watching and maybe a few more surprises before
releasing the next version. Note none of this would be possible without the
support and help from sascoo. Thanks bro <3
